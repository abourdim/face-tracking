# 😊 Face Tracking Project

## 📌 About
This project is a **Face Tracking Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (TypeScript)**.  
It uses a **camera** to detect a human face and track its movement in real time.

This project is made for **learning**, **students**, **beginners**, and **kids**.
